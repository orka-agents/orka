# Orka Helm chart

This chart is generated from `cmd/build/helmify`; edit the generator inputs and
run `make manifests` rather than editing generated chart copies directly. It
packages all thirteen canonical Orka CRDs under `crds/`.

## Fresh install

A normal install creates the CRDs before the templated release resources:

```bash
helm install orka charts/orka \
  --namespace orka-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

CRDs are cluster-scoped and shared by every Orka release. Use `--skip-crds`
only when a designated platform or GitOps workflow already manages compatible
Orka CRDs for the cluster.

Controller Services, worker ServiceAccounts, and worker RBAC are scoped to the
Helm release name. Run only one Orka controller release per namespace. If a
cluster has multiple releases, every release (including the first) must use a
cluster-unique release name or `fullnameOverride`, a separate controller
namespace, and a distinct, non-empty `controller.watchNamespace`. Do not mix a
cluster-wide watcher with namespace-scoped releases: gateway admission policies
would overlap. All releases share the same cluster-scoped CRDs.

## Upgrade

Helm installs files from `crds/` only during installation. It does not create or
update them during `helm upgrade`, including when upgrading from an older Orka
chart that installed no CRDs.

Apply the exact CRD specs from the target chart before upgrading the
controller. The first apply creates missing CRDs and transfers ownership of
present fields; the guarded JSON Patch then replaces each `spec` so fields
removed by the target version do not remain from an older Helm manager:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

TARGET_CHART=/absolute/path/to/orka-<version>.tgz
TARGET_CONTEXT=replace-with-context
TARGET_CRDS="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$TARGET_CRDS"' EXIT

helm show crds "$TARGET_CHART" > "$TARGET_CRDS"
kubectl --context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" apply \
  --server-side \
  --force-conflicts \
  --field-manager=orka-crd-lifecycle \
  -f "$TARGET_CRDS"

kubectl --context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" create --dry-run=client -f "$TARGET_CRDS" -o json | \
  jq -c '{name: .metadata.name, spec: .spec}' | \
  while IFS= read -r target; do
    name="$(jq -er '.name' <<< "$target")"
    spec="$(jq -ec '.spec' <<< "$target")"
    resource_version="$(kubectl --context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" get crd "$name" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.resourceVersion}')"
    patch="$(jq -cn --arg rv "$resource_version" --argjson spec "$spec" \
      '[{"op":"test","path":"/metadata/resourceVersion","value":$rv},{"op":"replace","path":"/spec","value":$spec}]')"
    kubectl --context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" patch crd "$name" --type=json -p "$patch"
    kubectl --context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" wait --for=condition=Established --timeout=60s "crd/$name"
  done

helm upgrade orka "$TARGET_CHART" \
  --namespace orka-system \
  --kube-context "$TARGET_CONTEXT" \
  --wait
```

A matching Orka source checkout provides the same guarded flow as
`scripts/apply-helm-crds.sh "$TARGET_CHART" "$TARGET_CONTEXT"`. Do not run
competing CRD apply workflows for the same cluster.

If another system owns the CRDs, perform the CRD-first step through that system,
wait for all thirteen CRDs to become `Established`, and then upgrade Orka.

If a previous release was uninstalled, update its retained CRDs first and install
the replacement release with `--skip-crds`.

## Uninstall and deletion

`helm uninstall` removes release resources but retains Orka's CRDs and custom
resources. This is Helm's standard `crds/` behavior and is not controlled by a
chart value.

Deleting a CRD also deletes every custom resource stored under that kind. Delete
Orka CRDs only as an explicit cluster-wide data-destruction operation after the
resources have been removed or backed up.
